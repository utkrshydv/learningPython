# # Sure! Here are some tailored practice questions focusing on the concepts you missed or got confused withâ€”mainly slicing and reversing parts of lists:

# # ---

# # ### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Question 1:**

# # Given a list, return the middle part **excluding the first and last elements**.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]
# # # Output: [10, 15, 20, 25]
# # ```
#  return lst[1:-1]
# # ---

# # ### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Question 2:**

# # Reverse the **first 4 elements** of a list, but keep the rest as is.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# # # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 6]
# # ```
# return lst[:4:-1].append(lst[4:6])
# # ---

# # ### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Question 3:**

# # Return the **last 4 elements** of the list in reverse order.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77]
# # # Output: [77, 66, 55, 44]
# # ```
# return lst[-1:-4]
# # ---

# # ### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Question 4:**

# # Return every **3rd element**, starting from the second element (index 1).

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
# # # Output: [1, 4, 7]
# # ```
# return lst[1::3]
# # ---

# # ### ðŸ”¹ **Practice Question 5:**

# # Copy the entire list but **exclude the last two elements**.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
# # # Output: [100, 200, 300]
# # ```
# return lst[:-2]
# # ---

# # Try these out, and Iâ€™ll review your solutions! Want me to give you hints too?


# Sure! Here are 4 focused practice questions to help you master list slicing and reversing â€” especially those tricky parts you struggled with:

# ---

# # ### 1. Return the **first 5 elements** of a list in **reverse order**.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
# # # Output: [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]
# # ```
# return lst[:5][::-1]
# # ---

# # ### 2. Return a list containing elements from index 3 up to (but **not including**) index 7.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# # # Output: [3, 4, 5, 6]
# # ```

# return lst[3:7]

# # ---

# # ### 3. Return the last 5 elements of the list, **in normal order**.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
# # # Output: [20, 25, 30, 35, 40]
# # ```
# return lst[-5:-1]
# # ---

# # ### 4. Return every 3rd element of the list, starting from index 2.

# # ```python
# # # Example:
# # lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
# # # Output: [3, 6, 9]
# # ```
# return lst[2::3]

# return lst[:]
# ---

# Try to write the slicing expressions (only the part inside brackets, like `lst[...]`) for each question.

# Awesome! Here's your **final slicing challenge** to combine everything you've learned â€” reversing, skipping, indexing, and slicing ranges.

# ---

# ### ðŸŒŸ **Ultimate Slicing Challenge**

# Youâ€™re given the list:

# ```python
# lst = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50]
# ```

# Write the slicing expression (just `lst[...]`) for each task:

# ---

# #### ðŸ”¹ **Q1: Get the last 3 elements in reverse order**

# âœ… Expected output: `[50, 45, 40]`
# lst[-1:-4:-1]
# ---

# #### ðŸ”¹ **Q2: Skip every other element from the list (starting at index 0)**

# âœ… Expected output: `[5, 15, 25, 35, 45]`
# lst[::2]
# ---

# #### ðŸ”¹ **Q3: Get elements from index 2 to index 7 (inclusive), in reverse**

# âœ… Expected output: `[40, 35, 30, 25, 20, 15]`
# lst[2:8][::-1]
# ---

# #### ðŸ”¹ **Q4: Copy the list but exclude the first 2 and last 2 elements**

# âœ… Expected output: `[15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40]`
# lst[2:-2]
# ---

# #### ðŸ”¹ **Q5: Reverse the entire list and then return every 3rd item from the reversed list**

# âœ… Expected output: `[50, 35, 20, 5]`
# lst[::-1][::3]
# ---

# Try writing the slicing expression (`lst[...]`) for each â€” then Iâ€™ll check and explain any tricky ones!
